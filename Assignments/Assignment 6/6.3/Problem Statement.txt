Q. Create same angular application as above but instead of using app.component.html and app.component.css file seperately add its contents in inline format inside app.component.ts file. 

Create a new workspace and an initial project: ng new MarvellousApp
	
Navigate inside the application: cd MarvellousApp
 
Serve the application: ng server 
		       http://localhost:4200
